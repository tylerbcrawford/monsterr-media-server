### 2. Medium Risk Areas
1. Configuration Management
   - Impact: Medium
   - Mitigation: Improve validation, add rollback
   - Timeline: 1 week

2. Monitoring
   - Impact: Medium
   - Mitigation: Implement complete monitoring
   - Timeline: 1-2 weeks

### 3. Low Risk Areas
1. Documentation
   - Impact: Low
   - Mitigation: Complete missing guides
   - Timeline: 1 week

## Beta Program Structure

### 1. Phase 1: Limited Beta (2 weeks)
- 10-20 users
- Core functionality focus
- Basic monitoring
- Direct support
- Daily feedback

### 2. Phase 2: Extended Beta (2-4 weeks)
- 50-100 users
- Full feature testing
- Complete monitoring
- Community support
- Weekly feedback

### 3. Phase 3: Open Beta (2-4 weeks)
- Unlimited users

- Regular updates

## Conclusion
While significant progress has been made, particularly with the modular configuration system, several critical issues must be addressed before beta testing. The primary focus should be on security, testing coverage, and error handling. With the proposed 3-week preparation plan, the project should be ready for a phased beta release starting with a limited user group.
