# Active Context

## Current Focus

Refining the setup wizard to improve usability and implementing visual design updates according to the design guide.

## Recent Changes

* Created a comprehensive plan for refining the setup wizard in `cline_docs/250304-visual-overhaul.md`.
* The plan includes splitting the services page into two pages (System-Related and Media-Related services).
* Added "Select All" functionality for service categories.
* Designed inline warnings for deselected required services.
* Planned a phased approach to visual design updates following the design guide.
* Organized preview HTML files into a dedicated `previews/` directory with subdirectories for `setup/`, `dashboard/`, and `general/`.
* Moved `install_media_server.sh` back to the root directory.

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1: Services Page Restructuring**
   * Update navigation component to show "Services (1/2)" and "Services (2/2)"
   * Create System Services Page with category selection
   * Create Media Services Page with category selection
   * Implement inline warning system for required services
   * Update data management for split services pages

2. **Phase 2: Visual Design Updates**
   * Apply initial color updates from the design guide
   * Update typography according to design guidelines
   * Improve layout with better spacing and alignment
   * Document future visual enhancements for later phases

3. **Documentation and Testing**
   * Update documentation to reflect the new setup wizard structure
   * Test the new UI with various selection scenarios
   * Verify navigation between split pages works correctly

## Current Status

* Setup wizard refinement plan is complete and documented.
* Project files are organized.
