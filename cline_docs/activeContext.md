# Active Context

## Current Focus

Refining the setup wizard to improve usability and implementing visual design updates according to the design guide.

## Recent Changes

* Created a comprehensive plan for refining the setup wizard in `cline_docs/250304-visual-overhaul.md`.
* The plan includes splitting the services page into two pages (System-Related and Media-Related services).
* Added "Select All" functionality for service categories.
* Designed inline warnings for deselected required services.
* Planned a phased approach to visual design updates following the design guide.
* Organized preview HTML files into a dedicated `previews/` directory with subdirectories for `setup/`, `dashboard/`, and `general/`.
* Moved `install_media_server.sh` back to the root directory.
* Implemented clickable navigation in the stepper for all setup wizard pages.
* Split the services page into System-Related (Services 1/2) and Media-Related (Services 2/2) pages.
* Added "Select All" buttons for each service category.
* Implemented inline warnings for required services.
* Applied initial visual design updates according to the design guide.
* Reordered service categories on the System Services page to place Remote Access right after Core Infrastructure.
* Implemented switchable dark/light mode with dark mode as the default theme.

* Fixed dark mode styling issues across setup wizard pages:
  * Updated resource summary, accordion, and select-all button styling to use theme variables instead of hardcoded colors
  * Fixed storage bar backgrounds to properly adapt to dark/light themes
  * Updated toggle switch slider backgrounds to use theme variables
  * Ensured consistent appearance and readability in both light and dark modes

* Enhanced visual design implementation:
  * Created a shared CSS file (shared-styles.css) to maintain consistency across all pages
  * Updated header in preview-step2-system.html to use all caps format for consistency with other pages
  * Removed unnecessary resource summary section from preview-step2-system.html for a cleaner interface
  * Improved interactive elements with hover/active states and subtle animations
  * Enhanced form elements with better spacing, focus states, and visual feedback
  * Standardized component styling (border radius, spacing, transitions)
  * Created comprehensive documentation of visual design implementation and future enhancements

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize Setup Wizard Refinement**
   * Test the new UI with various selection scenarios
   * Verify navigation between split pages works correctly
   * Ensure all visual elements are consistent with the design guide
   * ✅ Test dark/light mode toggle functionality across all pages
   * ✅ Implement shared CSS architecture for better maintainability

2. **Documentation Updates**
   * Update documentation to reflect the new setup wizard structure
   * Document the new navigation flow
   * Update screenshots in the documentation

3. **Prepare for Beta Testing**
   * Create a test plan for the refined setup wizard
   * Identify key user scenarios to test
   * Prepare feedback collection mechanism
