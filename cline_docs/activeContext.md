## Current Task
Standardizing setup wizard menu bubbles across all pages and in the React component.

## Recent Changes
1. Updated setup wizard menu bubbles in preview files:
   - Standardized styling with fixed width and centered text
   - Shortened step labels for better readability
   - Consistent color scheme for states

2. Implemented changes in React component (src/ui/setup/components/SetupWizard/index.jsx):
   - Created custom styled components (StepperContainer, StepBubble)
   - Fixed width of 120px for each bubble
   - Center-aligned text both horizontally and vertically
   - Added 1rem gaps between steps
   - Updated step labels to shorter versions
   - Implemented consistent color states:
     * Active: #1976d2 (blue)
     * Completed: #4caf50 (green)
     * Inactive: #e0e0e0 (gray)

## Next Steps
