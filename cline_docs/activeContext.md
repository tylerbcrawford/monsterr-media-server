# Active Context

## Current Focus

Refining the setup wizard to improve usability and implementing visual design updates according to the design guide.

## Recent Changes

* Created a comprehensive plan for refining the setup wizard in `cline_docs/250304-visual-overhaul.md`.
* The plan includes splitting the services page into two pages (System-Related and Media-Related services).
* Added "Select All" functionality for service categories.
* Designed inline warnings for deselected required services.
* Planned a phased approach to visual design updates following the design guide.
* Organized preview HTML files into a dedicated `previews/` directory with subdirectories for `setup/`, `dashboard/`, and `general/`.
* Moved `install_media_server.sh` back to the root directory.
* Implemented clickable navigation in the stepper for all setup wizard pages.
* Split the services page into System-Related (Services 1/2) and Media-Related (Services 2/2) pages.
* Added "Select All" buttons for each service category.
* Implemented inline warnings for required services.
* Applied initial visual design updates according to the design guide.
* Reordered service categories on the System Services page to place Remote Access right after Core Infrastructure.
* Implemented switchable dark/light mode with dark mode as the default theme.

* Fixed dark mode styling issues across setup wizard pages:
  * Updated resource summary, accordion, and select-all button styling to use theme variables instead of hardcoded colors
  * Fixed storage bar backgrounds to properly adapt to dark/light themes
  * Updated toggle switch slider backgrounds to use theme variables
  * Ensured consistent appearance and readability in both light and dark modes

* Enhanced visual design implementation:
  * Created a shared CSS file (shared-styles.css) to maintain consistency across all pages
  * Removed unnecessary resource summary section from preview-step2-system.html for a cleaner interface
  * Ensured consistent header format across all setup wizard pages
  * Improved interactive elements with hover/active states and subtle animations
  * Enhanced form elements with better spacing, focus states, and visual feedback
  * Standardized component styling (border radius, spacing, transitions)
  * Created comprehensive documentation of visual design implementation and future enhancements

* Improved typography and styling consistency:
  * Fixed CSS syntax errors in shared-styles.css
  * Added utility classes for visibility control (.hidden and .display-none)
  * Standardized typography sizes and spacing across all pages
  * Removed all inline styles in favor of shared CSS classes
  * Updated warning toggles to use CSS classes instead of inline styles
  * Removed redundant resource summary section from media services page

* Enhanced UI elements for better visibility and consistency:
  * Updated checkbox styling to be monochromatic with white checkmarks
  * Improved stepper navigation visibility in both themes
  * Unified all chips with consistent background and border styling
  * Enhanced "Select All" button contrast for better readability
  * Ensured all elements maintain proper visibility in both light and dark modes
* Fixed scaling issues in preview-step2-media.html:
  * Addressed inconsistent styling that was causing a scaling up effect
  * Added specific CSS rules to force proper zoom level
  * Ensured accordion elements render correctly with proper overflow handling

* **Examined zoom/scaling effect issue in the Services (2/2) page:**
   * Made attempt to address the scaling effect through CSS adjustments
   * Added zoom and overflow rules to try to mitigate the scaling effect
   * Decided to leave the existing implementation as is, since a complete resolution would require more extensive changes
   * Considered the current aesthetic acceptable for the beta phase
