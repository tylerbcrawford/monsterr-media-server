# System Patterns

## Architectural Patterns

### 1. Microservices Architecture
- Containerized services using Docker
- Each service has a single responsibility
- Services communicate over a shared Docker network
- Clear separation of concerns between media management, security, and monitoring

### 2. Security Layer
- **Frontend Security**
  - Nginx Proxy Manager for reverse proxy
  - Authelia for two-factor authentication
  - Redis for session management
  - Fail2Ban for intrusion prevention

- **Download Security**
  - VPN integration for secure downloads
  - Separate VPN container for NZBGet
  - Network isolation for sensitive services

### 3. Data Management
- **Volume Management**
  - Persistent storage for configurations
  - Shared media volumes between related services
  - Separate download and media directories
  - Consistent PUID/PGID across services

- **Media Organization**
  - Hierarchical media structure (movies, tv, music, books)
  - Automated media sorting and categorization
  - Centralized download management

### 4. Monitoring & Maintenance
- **System Monitoring**
  - Prometheus for metrics collection
  - Grafana for visualization
  - Tautulli for Plex statistics
  - Monitorr for service health monitoring

- **Automated Maintenance**
  - Watchtower for automatic updates
  - Recyclarr for configuration management
  - Unpackerr for automated extraction

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Container Orchestration
- Docker Compose for service orchestration
- Bridge network for internal communication
- Host network mode for specific services (Plex, Fail2Ban)
- Automatic container restart policies

### 2. Service Dependencies
- Clearly defined service dependencies
- Proper startup order management
- Shared resource access control

### 3. Configuration Management
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- External configuration files
- Consistent configuration structure across services
- Version-controlled service definitions

### 4. Network Architecture
- Isolated proxy network
- VPN integration for download services
- Port mapping for required services
- Internal service discovery

### 5. Resource Management
- Volume mapping for persistence
- Shared resource access
- Consistent environment variables
- Unified user/group management

## Design Principles

1. **Security First**
   - Two-factor authentication
   - VPN for sensitive traffic
   - Intrusion prevention
   - Secure proxy management

2. **Modularity**
   - Independent service scaling
   - Pluggable components
   - Clear service boundaries
   - Minimal inter-service dependencies

3. **Maintainability**
   - Automated updates
   - Centralized monitoring
   - Consistent configuration
   - Health checks and logging

4. **Scalability**
   - Independent service scaling
   - Resource isolation
   - Efficient resource sharing
   - Load management

5. **User Experience**
   - Unified interface (Organizr)
   - Automated media management
   - Consistent access methods
   - Integrated monitoring
