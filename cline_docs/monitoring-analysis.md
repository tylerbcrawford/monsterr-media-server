# Server Monitoring Systems Analysis

## Overview
The Monsterr Media Server implements a comprehensive monitoring solution that combines system-level metrics, container health monitoring, and automated alerting. This analysis covers the current monitoring infrastructure and provides insights into its capabilities and potential improvements.

## System Health Indicators & Resource Utilization

### Core Metrics
- CPU Usage
  - Threshold-based monitoring (warning: 90%)
  - Real-time load tracking
  - Historical trend analysis

- Memory Usage
  - Total and used memory tracking
  - Percentage-based thresholds
  - Automatic alerts for high usage

- Disk Space
  - Separate monitoring for root and media partitions
  - Configurable threshold warnings
  - Capacity trend analysis

### Implementation
- Automated checks every 5 minutes (configurable)
- Three-tier alert system: INFO, WARNING, ERROR
- Metric history retention for trend analysis

## Application & Service Status Monitoring

### Container Health Checks
- Docker container status monitoring
- Health check status tracking
- Individual service state monitoring
- Aggregate health status calculation

### Service Integration
- Status checks for all running containers
- Detailed health metrics per service
- Automatic recovery detection
- Service dependency tracking

## Error Logging & Alert Configuration

### Logging System
- Centralized logging in `/var/log/monsterr/`
- Structured log format with timestamps
- Separate files for:
  - Real-time monitoring events (monitor.log)
  - Daily summaries (daily_summary.log)
  - Service logs (monitor-service.log)

### Alert Configuration
- Desktop notifications via `notify-send`
- Configurable thresholds in config.env
- Multi-level alerting:
  - Critical alerts for errors
  - Warnings for threshold violations
  - Info for status updates

## Network Traffic & Security Monitoring

### Network Health Checks
- Internet connectivity verification
- DNS resolution testing
- Basic network performance monitoring
- Service accessibility checks

### Security Integration
- Integration with fail2ban
- VNC access monitoring
- Security event logging
- Access attempt tracking

## Database Performance Tracking
Currently implemented through container health checks, with potential for expansion to include:
- Query performance monitoring
- Connection pool status
- Transaction metrics
- Storage utilization

## User Activity & Access Logs

### Access Monitoring
- Service access tracking
- Authentication events
- User session monitoring
- Activity pattern analysis

### Audit Trail
- Comprehensive logging of user actions
- Authentication attempts
- Service access patterns
- Security-relevant events

## Backup & Recovery Monitoring

### Backup Tracking
- Automated backup verification
- Success/failure monitoring
- Storage space tracking
- Retention policy enforcement

### Recovery Testing
- Backup integrity verification
- Recovery process monitoring
- System state validation
- Restoration success tracking

## Custom Dashboards & Visualization

### Current Implementation
The system currently uses a command-line based monitoring approach:
- Daily summary reports in `/var/log/monsterr/daily_summary.log`
- Real-time monitoring events in `/var/log/monsterr/monitor.log`
- Service status through systemd journal
- Manual log analysis tools

While a dashboard service is defined (monsterr-dashboard.service), the web interface is not yet implemented. Current monitoring data can be accessed through:

```bash
# View daily system summary
cat /var/log/monsterr/daily_summary.log

# View real-time monitoring events
tail -f /var/log/monsterr/monitor.log

# View service status
systemctl status monsterr-monitor
```

### Recommended Dashboard Implementation
A web-based dashboard should be implemented to provide:
1. Real-time metrics visualization
2. Resource utilization graphs
3. Service health status overview
4. Alert history and management
5. System performance trends
6. Interactive data exploration

Technical recommendations for dashboard implementation:
- Node.js backend (aligned with existing service configuration)
- Real-time updates using WebSocket
- Time-series data visualization
- Role-based access control
- Mobile-responsive design

## Monitoring Platform Integration

### Current Integration
- Native system monitoring
- Docker health checks
- System service integration
- Log rotation integration

### Integration Opportunities
- Grafana metrics visualization
- Prometheus metric collection
- ELK Stack log aggregation
- Custom metrics exporters

## Historical Data Retention

### Data Management
- Weekly log rotation
- 4-week retention period
- Compressed archive storage
- Automated cleanup

### Metrics History
- System resource trends
- Service health patterns
- Alert frequency analysis
- Performance trending

## Alert Thresholds & Escalation

### Threshold Configuration
- Configurable via config.env
- Default thresholds:
  - Disk: 90%
  - Memory: 90%
  - CPU: 90%

### Escalation Procedures
- Immediate desktop notifications
- Log file entries
- Service status updates
- Automated health checks

## Compliance & Audit Logging

### Compliance Features
- Structured logging format
- Timestamp preservation
- Event categorization
- Access tracking

### Audit Capabilities
- System change logging
- User action tracking
- Service modifications
- Configuration changes

## Recommendations

### Short-term Improvements
1. Implement email notifications
2. Add metric visualization dashboard
3. Enhance backup monitoring
4. Expand network monitoring

### Long-term Enhancements
1. Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana
2. Implement advanced anomaly detection
3. Add predictive analytics
4. Enhance security monitoring

## Conclusion
The current monitoring system provides a solid foundation for system health and performance tracking. While it effectively covers basic monitoring needs, there are opportunities for enhancement through integration with specialized monitoring platforms and advanced analytics capabilities.
