# Docker Services Integration Analysis

## 1. Service Configuration in Installer Package

### Complete Implementations
- Core Infrastructure services (nginx-proxy-manager, authelia, redis, fail2ban) are properly configured in docker-compose.yml with correct dependencies and network settings
- Remote Access services (noVNC, VNC server) are integrated with security infrastructure
- Media Services (plex, sonarr, radarr, lidarr, bazarr) have appropriate volume mappings and dependencies
- Download Management services have proper VPN integration and security configurations
- Book Services (readarr, calibre, audiobookshelf, lazylibrarian) are fully integrated
