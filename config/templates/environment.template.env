# Monsterr Media Server Environment Configuration
# This is the main environment configuration file that sources all service-specific configurations.
# Copy this file to .env and customize the values for your environment.

# Load order:
# 1. Base configuration (required)
# 2. Service-specific configurations (optional, uncomment needed services)

# Base Configuration (Required)
source ${CONFIG_PATH}/defaults/base.env

# Media Services (Optional)
# Uncomment to enable media-related services like Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, etc.
#source ${CONFIG_PATH}/defaults/media-services.env

# Security Services (Optional)
# Uncomment to enable security-related services like Authelia, Fail2Ban, etc.
#source ${CONFIG_PATH}/defaults/security-services.env

# Monitoring Services (Optional)
# Uncomment to enable monitoring-related services like Prometheus, Grafana, etc.
#source ${CONFIG_PATH}/defaults/monitoring-services.env

# Configuration Validation
# The following files provide JSON schema validation:
# - config/schemas/nginx-proxy-config.schema.json
# - config/schemas/service-catalog.schema.yaml

# Important Notes:
# 1. All paths are relative to CONFIG_PATH defined in base.env
# 2. Service-specific configurations inherit and can override base settings
# 3. Use the schema files to validate your configurations
# 4. Keep this file in version control but exclude your actual .env file

# For detailed configuration instructions, see:
# docs/guides/configuration.md
