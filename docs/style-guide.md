# Monsterr Media Server Documentation Style Guide

This style guide outlines the standards and conventions for all Monsterr Media Server documentation.  Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency, clarity, and readability across all documents.

## General Guidelines

* **Target Audience:**  Write for a mixed audience of technical users, system administrators, and developers.  Explain complex concepts clearly and provide context where necessary.
* **Language:** Use clear, concise, and professional language. Avoid jargon and technical terms where possible.  When technical terms are necessary, provide definitions or links to relevant resources.
* **Tone:** Maintain a neutral and informative tone.  Avoid humor or opinions.
* **Consistency:**  Consistency is key.  Use the same terminology, formatting, and style throughout all documentation.

## Formatting

* **Headings:** Use atx-style headings (lines starting with `#`).  Use a single space after the `#` symbol.  Use sentence case for headings.

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

* **Lists:** Use either ordered (numbered) or unordered (bulleted) lists.  Use consistent spacing and indentation.

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
```

* **Code Blocks:** Use fenced code blocks (lines enclosed in triple backticks) for code examples.  Specify the language for syntax highlighting.

```markdown
\`\`\`bash
sudo apt update
\`\`\`

\`\`\`javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
\`\`\`
```

* **Emphasis:** Use italics (`*text*` or `_text_`) for emphasis and bold (`**text**` or `__text__`) for strong emphasis.  Use sparingly.

* **Links:** Use descriptive link text.  Avoid using "click here" or similar generic phrases.

```markdown
[Installation Guide](installation.md)
```

* **Images:** Use descriptive alt text for images.

```markdown
![Dashboard Screenshot](dashboard.png "Screenshot of the monitoring dashboard")
```

* **Tables:** Use Markdown tables for tabular data.  Align columns appropriately.

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|---|---|
| Value 1 | Value 2 |
```
