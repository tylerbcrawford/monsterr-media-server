### Backup Schedule

*   Configuration: Daily
*   Databases: Daily
*   Media: Weekly (incremental)
*   Full backup: Monthly

## Recovery Procedures

### Configuration Recovery

```bash
# Restore configuration files
restore_config() {
    - Verify backup integrity
    - Stop affected services
    - Restore configs
    - Verify permissions
    - Restart services
}
```

### Database Recovery

```bash
# Restore service databases
restore_database() {
    - Stop service
    - Import backup
    - Verify integrity
    - Start service
}
```

### Media Recovery

```bash
# Restore media files
restore_media() {
    - Verify backup
    - Restore incrementally
    - Update permissions
    - Scan libraries
}
```

## Space Management

### Retention Policy

*   Keep 7 daily backups
*   Keep 4 weekly backups
*   Keep 2 monthly backups
*   Auto-remove older backups

### Space Monitoring

*   Check available space before backup
*   Maintain minimum free space
*   Alert on space issues
*   Clean old backups as needed

## Verification System

### Backup Verification

*   Checksum verification
*   File count comparison
*   Permission checks
*   Database integrity tests

### Recovery Testing

*   Test restore procedures
*   Verify file integrity
*   Check service functionality
*   Validate permissions

## Notification System

### Status Updates

*   Backup completion status
*   Space usage alerts
*   Verification results
*   Error notifications

### Reporting

*   Daily backup summary
*   Weekly space usage
*   Monthly status report
*   Error logs

## User Interface

### Command Line Tools

```bash
# Basic commands
backup start      # Start backup
backup status     # Check status
backup verify     # Verify backup
backup restore    # Start restore
